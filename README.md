# Dehazing-by-NafNet

This project implements an image dehazing system using the NAFNet (Nonlinear Activation Free Network) architecture. The system removes haze from images, enhancing their clarity and visibility. Designed for real-world applications, this project leverages NAFNet's state-of-the-art performance to achieve high-quality results in challenging hazy conditions.

Features:

State-of-the-Art Dehazing: Utilizes NAFNet for superior performance in removing haze from images.

High Efficiency: Optimized architecture for faster and more reliable dehazing.

Versatile Input: Accepts single images or batches for processing.

Enhanced Visual Output: Outputs dehazed images with improved contrast and detail.

How It Works?

Input: The user provides hazy images as input.

Processing with NAFNet: The system processes the images using a pre-trained NAFNet model specifically tuned for dehazing.

Output: The dehazed images are saved or displayed with improved clarity and reduced haze artifacts.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch

Pre-Trained Model: NAFNet for image restoration tasks

Image Processing: OpenCV or PIL for handling input and output images

Applications:

Photography: Enhance hazy photos for better visual appeal.

Surveillance: Improve the visibility of surveillance footage in foggy conditions.

Autonomous Vehicles: Enhance camera feeds for improved navigation in hazy environments.

Aerial Imaging: Clear up images taken from drones or planes in misty conditions.

Future Enhancements:

1-Integration of a user interface for easy drag-and-drop dehazing.

2-Support for real-time dehazing of video feeds.

3-Training on custom datasets for domain-specific dehazing.
